Please note that the above playbook is highly simplified and assumes certain tasks (like determining if an interface exists before trying to set its configuration) are handled by appropriate roles within the chosen Ansible collection. Also, ensure you have created corresponding role modules for each supported vendor's device inside their respective collections under ios_config or a similar task that applies OSPF configurations on Cisco IOS devices as this example assumes such a module exists and is part of an installed Ansible collection supporting cisco.ios playbooks.
