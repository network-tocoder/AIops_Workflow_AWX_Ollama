        - name: Add Cisco to the default ansible collection for all playbooks if not already present as needed by ios_ospf module which may require this extra step. Note that in some cases, you might have separate Ansible collections (such as https://galaxy.ansible.com/arista-eos) and will need a different approach to load those

        - name: Configure OSPF area 0 on Cisco devices using ios_ospf module with appropriate variables, assume interface names are in 'Ethernet{{ item }}' format and they should be added to ospf configuration as well (not explicitly mentioned here but needed)

        - name: Configure OSPF area 0 on Arista devices using eos_ospf module (or appropriate EOS-specific task) with equivalent variables and tasks. This would require discovery of interfaces in a similar way as shown for Cisco, but tailored to the specifics of arista playbooks/modules
